**Note** : Website at https://basanti-theactroid.github.io/

--------------
Basanti is an interactive animatronic robot that is inspired by the human face itself. Equipped with the basic attributes of the human face, like speech, vision, motion, expressions and other facial parts; it is the complete framework that merely needs a synthetic face mask to be a human face lookalike.

Developed at Raman Lab - Department of Electrical Engineering, Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur, under the mentorship of Dr. Rajesh Kumar, Basanti 1.0 is the first of its kind in-house developed actroid with the project made from scratch at our own facility.
