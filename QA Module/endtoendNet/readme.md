End to End memory networks
===================

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08895.pdf) that explains about it.

For understanding [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and [Lasagne](https://lasagne.readthedocs.io), follow the documentation. Most of the code is forked from ```github.com/npow/memN2N``` and I have not written the entire code, though I fully understand it. 

The network built is a [closed QA](https://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/StrohMathur.pdf) system and the data that we are feeding is of [babi](www.fb.com/babi) facebook task.  


Next Challenges
-------------

1. Finding datasets that are much more informative and have better utility for our system.
2. Re-designing the network for varied data usage.
3. This will be the base of our QA for now. If need be, then will shift to [dynamic memory networks](https://web.archive.org/web/20160201031743/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07285v1.pdf) and [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01417v1.pdf).
